### Hi there 👋

🙂 I'm Clément Nerma, a professional web developer (more precisely a Nest.js backend developer) living near by Nantes, in France

👦 I'm fond of programming since I'm 10 years old

💻 I often make small command-line utilities as well as big projects like operating systems ([check it out!](https://github.com/ClementNerma/NightOS))

📖 I also write fantasy and science fiction books on my free time

🐉 By the way, my last name is a pseudonym that comes from the name of a dragon I imagined when I was a child 🐉
