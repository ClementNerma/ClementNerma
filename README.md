### 👋 Hi there. Welcome to my profile.

🙂 I'm Clément, a professional low-level & web developer living in France

💻 I mainly make low-level stuff like [virtual machines](https://github.com/ClementNerma/MRVM), [operating systems](https://github.com/ClementNerma/NightOS) or [command-line shells](https://github.com/ClementNerma/ReShell)

💼 If you want to reach out to build a project (website, low-level tool, ...), feel free to send an e-mail at [nermapro@fastmail.com](mailto:nermapro@fastmail.com)
