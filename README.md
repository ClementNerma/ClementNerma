### 👋 Hi there. Welcome to my profile.

🙂 I'm Clément Nerma, a professional web developer (more precisely a Nest.js backend developer) living in France

👦 I'm fond of programming since I'm 10 years old

💻 I make stuff like [virtual machines](https://github.com/ClementNerma/MRVM) and sometimes big projects like full-powered [operating systems](https://github.com/ClementNerma/NightOS) and [shells](https://github.com/ClementNerma/ReShell)

📖 I also write fantasy and science fiction books on my free time

📖 Want to read some articles I read? Check out my [blog](https://clementnerma.github.io/EverythingGeeks/)!

📫 You can also contact me using my usual e-mail address: [clement.nerma@gmail.com](mailto:clement.nerma@gmail.com)

🐉 By the way, my last name is a pseudonym that comes from the name of a dragon I imagined when I was a child 🐉
